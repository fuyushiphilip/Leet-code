Question
    An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

    Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - So an ugly number only has prime factors limited to 2, 3, and 5
        - If we are given a number 'n'
            - We can continuously divide 'n' by 5, 3, 2 to check if it reaches
              the value of 1
        - For example: 15
            - 15 is divisible by 5
                - 15 / 5 = 3
            - 3 is divisible by 3
                - 3 / 3 = 1
        - If we reach the value of 1
            - This means the number 'n' has only prime factors limited to 2, 3, 5

Answer
    - Lets validate the input parameter
        - if 'n' is less than or equal to 0
            - Return false
    - While 'n' is divisible by 5
        - Divide 'n' by 5
    - While 'n' is divisible by 3
        - Divide 'n' by 3
    - While 'n' is divisible by 2
        - Divide 'n' by 2
    - Return true if 'n' is equal to 1
        - Else, return false

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(logn), where 'n' is the input value
        - O(logn), we divide 'n' by 5, 3 or 2 each time
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
