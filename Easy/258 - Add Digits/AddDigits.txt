Question
    Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its
    digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - Lets go over the different approach
        - The first approach is the most straightforward
            - We will continuously find the sum of the digits
              until the sum is a single digit
        - A more optimized approach is to use the concept of digital root
            - Digital root allows us to find the single digit sum
              from the sum of the digits
            - The rule states that for any value 'n'
                - The digital root of 0 is equal to 0
                - The digital root of multiples of 9 is equal to 9
                    - For example: 81 => 9
                - The digital root of numbers that are divisible by 9
                  is equal to 'n % 9'
                    - Example: 38 => 38 % 9 = 2

Answer
    - If 'num' is equal to 0
        - Return 0
    - If 'num' is divisible by 9
        - Return '9'
    - Return 'num % 9'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(1)
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
