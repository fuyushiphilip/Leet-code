Question
    Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We will be processing the letters from right -> left
        - How can we retrieve the rightmost letter?
            - We can use the modulus operator
                - For example: x = 27
                    - 27 % 26 = 1 = A
        - After processing a letter
            - How can we process the next letter?
                - For example: x = 27
                    - 27 / 26 = 1
                - 1 % 26 = 1 = A
        - The next part is how can we convert a digit 'y' to a letter?
            - We will first need to decrement 'y' then convert
              to a letter by adding 'A'
                - (char)((1 - 1) + 'A') = (char) (0 + 'A') = 'A'

Answer
    - Create a StringBuilder 'str' to keep track of the letters
    - While 'columnNumber' is greater than 0
        - Decrement 'columnNumber'
        - Find the 'rightMost' letter
            - rightMost = (char)((columnNumber % 26) + 'A')
        - Append 'rightMost' to 'str'
        - Set 'columnNumber' to 'columnNumber / 26'
    - Reverse ordering of characters inside 'str'
    - return a string representation of 'str'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(logn) + O(logn) = O(logn), where 'n' is the input value
        - O(logn), we process the input number by dividing it by 26 each time
        - O(logn), reverse ordering
    - Space Complexity = O(logn), where 'n' is the input value
        - O(logn), StringBuilder
