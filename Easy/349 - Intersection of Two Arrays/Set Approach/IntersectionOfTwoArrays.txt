Question
    Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2,
    return an array of their intersection.
    Each element in the result must be unique
    and you may return the result in any order.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - For each of the element 'x' inside 'nums2'
        - We will need a quick way to find 'x' inside 'nums1'
    - We can create a HashSet to store all of the elements inside 'nums1'
        - Then we can use the set for quick lookup

Answer
    - Create two fields
        - seen, HashSet for elements inside 'nums1'
        - intersections, HashSet for the intersections
    - Iterate through the elements of 'nums1', denoted as 'x'
        - Add 'x' to 'seen'
    - Iterate through the elements of 'nums2', denoted as 'x'
        - If 'seen' contains 'x'
            - Add 'x' to 'intersections'
    - Return an array representation of 'intersections'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(m + n), where 'm,n' are the length of the two input arrays
        - O(m + n), 2 iterations
    - Space Complexity = O(3m) = O(m), where 'm' is the length of 'nums1'
        - O(3m), 2 sets + 1 array
