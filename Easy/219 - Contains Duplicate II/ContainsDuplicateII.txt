Question
    Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return
    true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the
    array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - For each of the element 'x' at index 'j'
        - We will want to find a previous element 'x' at index 'i', where
          the difference 'j - i' is less than or equal to 'k'
        - This means we will need a quick way to check element and its
          associated index
            - We can create a HashMap, where we keep track of 'element -> index'

Answer
    - Create a HashMap 'map' to keep track of 'element -> index'
    - Iterate through the indices of 'nums', denoted as 'j'
        - If 'map' contains 'nums[j]' AND 'j - map.get(nums[j])' is less than or equal to 'k'
            - Return true
        - Put 'nums[j]' and 'j' into the 'map'
    - Return false, if we have failed to find the pair

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n), visit each index once
    - Space Complexity = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n), 'map'
