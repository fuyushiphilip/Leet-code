Question
    You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend:
        - Initially, there is a heap of stones on the table.
        - You and your friend will alternate taking turns, and you go first.
        - On each turn, the person whose turn it is will remove 1 to 3 stones from the heap.
        - The one who removes the last stone is the winner.

    Given n, the number of stones in the heap, return true
    if you can win the game assuming both you and your friend play optimally, otherwise return false.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - Lets go over the difference cases
        - For each of the value 'n'
            - If 'n' is equal to '1 -> 3'
                - Then we will always win
            - If 'n' is equal to '4'
                - We will always lose
            - If 'n' is equal to '5'
                - We can pick 1 stone and the friend will always lose
            - If 'n' is equal to '6'
                - We can pick 2 stones and the friend will always lose
            - If 'n' is equal to '7'
                - We can pick 3 stones and the friend will always lose
            - If 'n' is equal to '8'
                - We will always lose

Answer
    - Return true if 'n' is not divisible by 4

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(1)
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
