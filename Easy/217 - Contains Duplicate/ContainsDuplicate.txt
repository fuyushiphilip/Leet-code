Question
    Given an integer array nums, return true if any value
    appears at least twice in the array, and return false
    if every element is distinct.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - For each of the element 'x' in the input array
        - We will need a quick way to check if 'x' is seen before
        - We can create a HashSet to keep track of previously seen elements
            - Then we can quickly check if an element 'x' exist before
              by checking the HashSet

Answer
    - Create a HashSet 'seen'
    - Iterate through the elements of 'nums', denoted as 'x'
        - If 'seen' contains 'x'
            - Return true
        - Add 'x' to 'seen'
    - Return false

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n), visit each element once
    - Space Complexity = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
       - O(n), HashSet
