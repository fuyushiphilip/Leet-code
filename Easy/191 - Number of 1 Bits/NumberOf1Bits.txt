Question
    Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and
    returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as
    the Hamming weight).

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We can use Brian Kernighan's Algorithm
        - In the algorithm, it states that we can remove the current rightmost
          set bit using the following formula
            - n & (n - 1)
            - How does this formula work?
                - Example: 100
                    - 100 & 011 = 000
    - We will continuously apply the formula until 'n' reaches 0

Answer
    - Create a variable 'ones'
    - While 'n' is not equal to 0
        - Set 'n' to 'n & (n - 1)'
        - Increment 'ones'
    - Return 'ones'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(32) = O(1)
        - O(32), maximum number of bits that 'n' can have
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
