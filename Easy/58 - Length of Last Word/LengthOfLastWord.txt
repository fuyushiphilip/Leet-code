Question
    Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces,
    return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word
    does not exist, return 0.

    A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

    Constraints:
        - 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
        - s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We will be checking the characters from right -> left
    - We should note that there may be trailing spaces inside the input string
        - We will want to skip all of the trailing spaces before
          we starting count the characters inside the last word

Answer
    - Create two variables
        - i, our current location inside 's', initially 's.length() - 1'
        - length, the length of the last word
    - While 'i' is greater than or equal to 0 AND the current character
      at 'i' is equal to ' '
        - Decrement 'i'
    - While 'i' is greater than or equal to 0 AND the current characters
      at 'i' is not equal to ' '
        - Decrement 'i'
        - Increment 'length'
    - Return 'length'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the length of the input string
        - O(n), visit each index once
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
