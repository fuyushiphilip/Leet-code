Question
    Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list,
    and return the reversed list.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - For each of the node 'x' inside the input list
        - We will first want to disconnect 'x'
        - Then we prepend 'x' to our 'reverse' list

Answer
    - Create the following variables
        - reverse, the head of the reverse list, initially 'null'
        - node, our current position, initially 'head'
    - While 'node' is not equal to null
        - Create a variable 'next' and set it to 'node.next'
        - Set 'node.next' to 'reverse'
        - Set 'reverse' to 'node'
        - Set 'node' to 'next'
    - Return 'reverse'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n), where 'n' is the number of nodes
        - O(n), visit each node once
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
