Question
    Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum,
    return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that
    adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

    A leaf is a node with no children.

    Constraints:
        - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
        - -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
        - -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We will implement a recursive approach
        - We will be keeping track of the current sum of our path
          in the recursive parameters
        - For each of the node 'x'
            - We will want to add the value of 'x' to the current sum
            - If 'x' is a leaf node
                - We will want to return true if the current sum
                  is equal to 'targetSum'
                - If the current sum is not equal to 'targetSum'
                    - We can return false

Answer
    - Implement the recursive approach
        - What parameters do we need?
            - node, the current node we are visiting
            - sum, the current sum, initially 0
            - targetSum, the input target sum
        - What is the base case?
            - if 'node' is equal to null
                - return false
        - In each of the recursive call
            - Increment 'sum' by 'node.val'
            - If 'node' is a leaf node
                - Return true if 'sum' is equal to 'targetSum'
                - Else, return false
            - Recursively check if we can find a path in the 'left' subtree
                - node => node.left
            - Recursively check if we can find a path in the 'right' subtree
                - node => node.right
            - Return true if either of the paths is valid
            - Return false, if both of the paths are invalid

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the number of nodes
        - O(n), visit each node once
    - Space Complexity = O(h), where h is the height of the tree
        - O(h), recursive call stack memory
