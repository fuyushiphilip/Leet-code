Question
    Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We can implement a two pointer approach
        - One pointer 'i' will scan from left -> right
        - One pointer 'j' will scan from right -> left
    - Then in each of the iteration
        - We will be swapping the characters at the two indices

Answer
    - Create two variables
        - i, initially 0, left pointer
        - j, initially 's.length - 1', right pointer
    - While 'i' is less than 'j'
        - Swap the characters at indices 'i' and 'j'
        - Increment 'i'
        - Decrement 'j'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n / 2) = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n / 2), two pointer approach to swap characters
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
