Question
    Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates
    such that each element appears only once. Return the linked
    list sorted as well.

    Constraints:
        - The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
        - -100 <= Node.val <= 100
        - The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order

Thoughts Before Coding
    - The input list is sorted
        - This means all of the duplicate nodes are grouped together
    - For each of the node 'x'
        - We can check if 'x' is a duplicate node by comparing with the next node 'x.next'
        - If 'x.val' is equal to 'x.next.val'
            - We will want to skip all of the nodes with 'x.val' until we reach the last node
            - We will be appending the last node to our resulting list
        - If 'x.val' is not equal to 'x.next.val'
            - Then we can just append 'x' to our resulting list

Answer
    - Create the following variables
        - sHead, sentinel head of the resulting list
        - sTail, sentinel tail of the resulting list, initially 'sHead'
        - node, our current location inside the input list, initially 'head'
    - While 'node' is not equal to null
        - While 'node.next' is not null AND 'node.val' is equal to 'node.next.val'
            - Set 'node' to 'node.next'
        - Create a variable 'next' and set it to 'node.next'
        - Set 'node.next' to null
        - Set 'sTail.next' to 'node'
        - Set 'sTail' to 'node'
        - Set 'node' to 'next'
    - Return 'sHead.next'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the input list
        - O(n), visit each node once
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
