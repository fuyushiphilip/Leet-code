Question
    Given an integer array nums where every element appears three
    times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single
    element and return it.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We will need a way to keep track each its element and also
      its associated frequency
    - We can create a HashMap to keep track of element and frequency
        - x -> frequency
    - Then the element with a frequency of 1 will be our result

Answer
    - Create a HashMap 'map' to keep track of each element and frequency
    - Iterate through the elements of the input array, denoted as 'x'
        - Increment frequency of 'x' inside 'map'
    - Iterate through the keys of 'map', denoted as 'x'
        - If 'map.get(x)' is equal to 1
            - Return 'x'
    - Return -1

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n) + O(n / 3) = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n), finding frequency of elements
        - O(n / 3), finding the single number
    - Space Complexity = O(n / 3) = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n / 3), 'map'
