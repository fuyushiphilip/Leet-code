Question
    Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path
    from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers
    along its path.

    Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

    Constraints:
        - m == grid.length
        - n == grid[i].length
        - 1 <= m, n <= 200
        - 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

Thoughts Before Coding
    - In the 2D bottom up approach
        - In each of the iteration
            - We are only relying on values from the rows 'r' and 'r + 1'
            - this means we can represent the 2D matrix using a single array
                - Then in each of the row iteration
                    - We will updating the values from the previous row iteration

Answer
    - Create an array 'minSum' to keep track of the minimum path sum
    - Iterate through the indices from 'grid.length - 1 -> 0', denoted as 'r'
        - Iterate through the indices from 'grid[r].length - 1 -> 0', denoted as 'c'
            - if 'r' and 'c' is at the bottom right corner
                - Set 'minSum[c]' to 'grid[r][c]'
                - continue to next iteration
            - Create a variable 'cur' to 'minSum[c]'
            - Set 'minSum[c]' to 'Integer.MAX_VALUE'
            - If 'r' is not at the last row
                - Update 'minSum[c]' if 'cur + grid[r][c]' is smaller
            - If 'c' is not at the last column
                - Update 'minSum[c]' if 'minSum[c + 1] + grid[r][c]' is smaller
    - Return 'minSum[0]'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(mn), where m,n are number of rows and columns
        - O(mn), nested 'for' loop
    - Space Complexity = O(n), where 'n' is the number of columns
        - O(mn), 'minSum' array
