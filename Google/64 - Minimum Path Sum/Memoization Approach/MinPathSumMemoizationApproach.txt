Question
    Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path
    from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers
    along its path.

    Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

    Constraints:
        - m == grid.length
        - n == grid[i].length
        - 1 <= m, n <= 200
        - 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100

Thoughts Before Coding
    - In the recursive approach
        - It was very inefficient due to overlapping recursive calls
        - We can avoid overlapping recursive call calls using memoization
    - What do we need to cache?
        - In each of the recursive call
            - We are trying to find the minimum path 'sum' at the current 'r, c'
            - This means we can cache 'r, c' with 'sum'

Answer
    - Create a 2D matrix 'memo' to cache previously calculated results
        - The rows represent 'r'
        - The columns represent 'c'
        - The values represent minimum path 'sum'
    - Implement the top down memoization approach
        - What parameters do we need?
            - r, the current row
            - c, the current column
            - grid, input grid
            - memo, cache
        - What is the base case?
            - When 'r, c' is at the bottom right corner
                - Return 'grid[r][c]'
            - If 'memo[r][c]' is not equal to 0
                - Return 'memo[r][c]'
        - In each of the recursive call
            - Create a variable 'minSum' to keep track of the minimum sum, initially 'Integer.MAX_VALUE'
            - If 'r' is not at the last row
                - Recursively find the 'sum1' if we move downward
                    - r => r + 1
                - Update 'minSum' if 'sum1 + grid[r][c]' is smaller
            - If 'c' is not at the last column
                - Recursively find the 'sum2' if we move rightward
                    - c => c + 1
                - Update 'minSum' if 'sum2 + grid[r][c]' is smaller
            - Put 'minSum' at 'memo[r][c]'
            - Return 'minSum'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(m*n), where m,n are the number of rows and columns
        - O(m*n), there are 'm*n' possible states with 'r, c'
    - Space Complexity = O(m + n) + O(m*n) = O(m*n), where m,n are the number of rows and columns
        - O(m + n), recursive call stack memory
        - O(m*n), 'memo' matrix
