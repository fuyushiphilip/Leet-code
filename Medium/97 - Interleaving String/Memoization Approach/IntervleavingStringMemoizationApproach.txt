Question
    Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.

    An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are
    divided into non-empty substrings such that:
        - s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
        - t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
        - |n - m| <= 1

    The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...

    Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.

    Constraints:
        - 0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
        - 0 <= s3.length <= 200
        - s1, s2, and s3 consist of lower-case English letters.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - The recursive approach is inefficient due to overlapping recursive calls
        - We can avoid overlapping recursive calls using memoization
    - What do we need to cache?
        - In each of the recursive call
            - We are checking we can interleave 'canInterleave' the two strings at
              the current indices 'i' and 'j'
            - This means we can cache 'i' and 'j' with 'canInterleave'

Answer
    - Lets validate the input parameter
        - If the sum of the lengths of 's1' and 's2' is not equal to the length of 's3'
            - Return false
    - Create a 2D matrix 'memo' to cache previously calculated results
        - The rows indicate 'i'
        - The columns indicate 'j'
        - The values indicate 'canInterleave'
    - Implement the top down memoization approach
        - What parameters do we need?
            - s1, input string
            - s2, input string
            - s3, input string
            - i, our current location inside 's1'
            - j, our current location inside 's2'
            - memo, cache
        - What is the base case?
            - If 'i' and 'j' are both of out of bound
                - Return true
            - If 'memo[i][j]' is not equal to null
                - Return 'memo[i][j]'
        - In each of the recursive calls
            - If 'i' is not out of bound AND the current character at index 'i' inside 's1' is
              equal to the character at index 'i + j' inside 's3'
                - Recursively check if we can interleave the strings by moving 'i' forward
                    - i => i + 1
                - If the recursive call is true
                    - Put true at 'memo[i][j]'
                    - Return true
            - If 'j' is not out of bound AND the current character at index 'j' inside 's2' is
              equal to the character at index 'i + j' inside 's3'
                - Recursively check if we can interleave the strings by moving 'j' forward
                    - j => j + 1
                - If the recursive call is true
                    - Put true at 'memo[i][j]'
                    - Return true
            - Put false at 'memo[i][j]'
            - Return false

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(m*n), where 'm,n' are the length of the two input string
        - O(m*n), there is a total of 'm * n'
    - Space Complexity = O(m + n) + O(m * n) = O(m * n), where 'm,n' are the length of the two input string
        - O(m + n), recursive call stack memory
        - O(m * n), 'memo' cache
