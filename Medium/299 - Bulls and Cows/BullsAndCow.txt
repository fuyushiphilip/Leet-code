Question
    You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

    You write down a secret number and ask your friend to
    guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess,
    you provide a hint with the following info:
        - The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
        - The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

    Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess,
    return the hint for your friend's guess.

    The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of
    bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess
    may contain duplicate digits.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - For each of the index 'i'
        - If we currently have two digits 'c' and 'd' inside 'secret' and 'guess' respectively
            - If 'c' is equal to 'd'
                - Then we can increment the number of bulls
            - If 'c' is not equal to 'd'
                - We will need to save 'c' somewhere
                    - Since, 'c' may appear multiple times inside 'secret'
                    - We will need to keep track of 'c' and also its frequency
                - We can create a HashMap to keep track of 'c -> frequency'
    - We can perform another scan inside 'guess' to find out the number of cows
    - Lets bring it all together
        - The first scan will find the number of bulls
        - The second scan will find the number of cows

Answer
    - Create a HashMap 'map' to keep track of 'c -> frequency'
    - Create two variables
        - bulls, # of bulls
        - cows, # of cows
    - Iterate through the indices of 'secret', denoted as 'i'
        - Retrieve the two digits 'c' and 'd' at index 'i' inside 'secret' and 'guess'
        - If 'c' is equal to 'd'
            - Increment 'bulls'
        - Else
            - Increment the frequency of 'c' inside 'map'
    - Iterate through the indices of 'guess', denoted as 'i'
        - Retrieve the two digits 'c' and 'd' at index 'i' inside 'secret' and 'guess'
        - If 'c' is equal to 'd'
            - continue to next index
        - If 'd' is inside 'map' AND 'map.get(d)' is greater than 0
            - Decrement frequency of 'd' inside 'map'
            - Increment 'cows'
    - Return a string representation of 'bulls' and 'cows'

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n) + O(n) = O(n), where 'n' is the length of either input strings
        - O(n), find the number of bulls
        - O(n), find the number of cows
    - Space Complexity = O(10) = O(1)
        - O(10), 'map'
