Question
    Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

    A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
    The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

    Return a string of the words in reverse order
    concatenated by a single space.

    Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or
    multiple spaces between two words. The returned string
    should only have a single space separating the words.
    Do not include any extra spaces.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - Lets break the question down into parts
        - The first part we need to handle is the leading and trailing spaces
            - We can remove the spaces by using the 'trim' method
        - The next part is splitting the input string by 1 or more spaces
            - We can use the 'split' method and split the words by
              1 or more spaces
        - The next part is reversing the ordering of the words
            - We now have an array of 'words'
            - We can convert the array to a list, then we can
              reverse the ordering of the words inside the list
        - The last part is joining the words using a single space

Answer
    - Trim the input string 's'
    - Split the input string into an array of 'words'
        - Make sure to handle the case where there is 1 or more spaces
    - Convert the array of words into a list
    - Reverse the ordering of the words inside the list
    - Return a string representation of the words inside the list
      separated by a single space

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n), where 'n'
      is the length of the input string
        - O(n), trim
        - O(n), split the input string into an array of 'words'
        - O(n), converting the words array into a list
        - O(n), reverse ordering of list
        - O(n), string representation of the 'list'
    - Space Complexity = O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n), where 'n'
       is the length of the input string
        - O(n), trimmed string
        - O(n), array of words
        - O(n), list of words
        - O(n), resulting string
