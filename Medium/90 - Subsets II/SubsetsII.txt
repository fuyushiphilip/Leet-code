Question
    Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates,
    return all possible subsets (the power set).

    The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return
    the solution in any order.

    Constraints:
        - 1 <= nums.length <= 10
        - -10 <= nums[i] <= 10

Thoughts Before Coding
    - We will be implementing a recursive backtracking approach
        - For each of the element 'x' inside the input array at index 'i'
        - After adding 'x' to our current subset
            - We will continue our search from 'i + 1'
        - After accounting for 'x', we will want to backtrack of steps to give space
          for the next element and allow us to find the next subset
            - This can be done by removing the last element that was added into our current subset
    - Since the solution set must not contain duplicates
        - We must sort the input array in ascending order
            - This will allow us to group duplicate numbers together
        - If we have already used an element 'y' for index 'j' inside our subset
            - We will want to skip all of the future occurrences of 'j' inside our subset

Answer
    - Sort the input array in ascending order
    - Create our list of lists 'result' to keep track of all subsets
    - Implement our recursive backtracking approach
        - What parameters do we need?
            - i, our current starting index
            - nums, the input array
            - subset, the current subset
            - result, list of all subsets
        - In each of the recursive call
            - Add a copy of 'subset' to 'result'
            - Iterate through the indices from 'i -> nums.length - 1', denoted as 'j'
                - If 'j' is not equal to 'i' AND 'nums[j - 1]' is equal to 'nums[j]'
                    - continue to next iteration
                - Add 'nums[j]' to 'subset'
                - Recursively find the rest of the elements in our subset
                    - i => j + 1
                - Remove the last element from 'subset'
    - return 'result'
