Question
    Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.  There are an even number of piles arranged in a row,
    and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].

    The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.  The total number of stones is
    odd, so there are no ties.

    Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of
    stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.  This continues until there are no more
    piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.

    Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True if and only if Alex wins the game.

Thoughts Before Coding
    - In the 3D bottom up approach
        - In each of the iteration
            - We are only relying on values from the x-axis 'i' and 'i + 1'
            - This means we can create a 2D matrix to replace our 3D matrix
                - Then in each of the iteration
                    - We will be replacing the values at the previous iteration

Answer
    - Create a 2D matrix 'score'
        - The rows represent 'j'
        - The columns represent 'p'
    - Create a variable 'n', which is equal to 'piles.length'
    - Iterate through from 'n - 1 -> 0', denoted as 'i'
        - Iterate through from '0 -> n - 1', denoted as 'j'
            - Create a variable 'prev' to keep track of the previous value before
              we have replaced it, initially be 0
            - Iterate through from '1 -> 0', denoted as 'p'
                - If 'i' is greater than 'j'
                    - continue to next iteration
                - If 'i' is equal to 'j'
                    - Set 'prev' to 'score[j][p]'
                    - If 'p' is equal to 0 (Alex)
                        - Set 'score[j][p]' to 'piles[i]'
                    - Else (Lee)
                        - Set 'score[j][p]' to '-piles[i]'
                    - continue to next iteration
                - Create a variable 'cur' to keep track of the current value 'score[j][p]'
                - If 'p' is equal to 0 (Alex)
                    - Set 'score[j][p]' to the larger value between
                        - prev + piles[i]
                        - score[j - 1][1] + piles[j]
                - Else (Lee), ('p' is equal to 1)
                    - Set 'score[j][p]' to the smaller value between
                        - score[j][0] - piles[i]
                        - score[j - 1][0] - piles[j]
                - Set 'prev' to 'cur'
    - Return true 'score[n - 1][0]' is greater than 0 (Alex has won)
        - score[n - 1][0] is the score with the current left and right boundaries
          and 'Alex' starting first

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(n * 2) = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n * 2), nested 'for' loops
    - Space Complexity = O(n * 2) = O(n), where 'n' is the length of the input array
        - O(n * 2), 'score' matrix
